        <h1>AutoAttend Class Attendance</h1>
        <p>AutoAttend is an application designed to simplify class attendance by allowing students to scan their fingerprint to
          mark their attendance for the day. Teachers can create their account then add their students to the class, once students
          are added the teacher can then view the class attendance in the dashboard.  Teachers will be able to view the student name, if
          they attended class and what time they scanned in.  Students can be added at anytime by the teacher by simply going to
          register a student entering their name and scanning in their fingerprint.
